## Ele (the elephant that never forgets)

Ele is a super-simple logging library.  It lets you:

* store any js value directly for later inspection/storage
* wrap any function so that its occurances get logged automatically
* See the timestamp associated with any occurance of logging

## API 

Creating a logger instance is as easy as calling the library function:

```javascript
    var log = ele()
```
